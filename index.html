             <p>Beavers are large, semi-aquatic rodents known for their ability to build dams and lodges. They are keystone species that shape their environment by creating wetlands.</p>

                <aside><p>Beavers are the largest rodents in North America. Adult beavers typically range from 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 meters) in length, including their tail. Their body length alone is around 2 to 2.5 feet (60 to 75 cm). The tail, which is wide and flat, can add another 1 foot (30 cm) to their total length.</p></aside> <hr>

                <img class="pic" src="images/weight.jpg">
                <aside><p>Beavers are quite heavy for rodents, with adult beavers generally weighing between 30 and 70 pounds (14 to 32 kg). Male beavers tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females. Their weight varies depending on their habitat and food supply, with beavers in colder regions often being larger.</p></aside> <hr>
                <p id="teeth">🦷 <b>Teeth:</b> Large, orange, ever-growing incisors</p>
                <img class="pic" src="images/teeth.jpg"> 
                <aside><p>Beavers have large, sharp, orange-colored incisors that are constantly growing throughout their lives. Their incisors are well-adapted for gnawing through wood. The orange color comes from iron in the enamel, which strengthens the teeth for chewing through tough materials like tree bark. Beavers' teeth are self-sharpening due to their constant wear on wood. Their sharp, chisel-like teeth can grow up to 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) long. They also have strong molars in the back of their mouths to help grind up the wood. These teeth are critical for their ability to cut down trees and build dams.</p></aside><hr>

                <img class="pic" src="images/beaver_eating.jpg">
                <aside><p>Beavers are herbivores and primarily feed on a variety of plant materials. Their diet mainly consists of:

                  Tree bark: Especially the bark of willows, aspens, and cottonwoods.
                  Twigs: Young tree branches, which are also a vital food source.
                  Aquatic plants: They often eat the roots, leaves, and stems of plants found in ponds, lakes, and rivers.
                  Woody plants: In the winter months, beavers rely heavily on stored branches and twigs, which they gather in the fall before the water freezes.
                  Beavers are known for their ability to cut down trees and use them for both food and construction purposes.</p></aside> <hr>

                <img class="pic" src="images/home.jpg"> 
                <aside id="aside_home"><p>Beavers are known for their remarkable ability to build dams and lodges in or near water. Their habitats typically include:

                  Freshwater environments: Rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, and marshes are common areas for beaver activity.
                  Dams: Beavers construct dams to create deep, still water, which protects them from predators and helps to ensure a stable supply of food (underwater tree branches). Dams are built from branches, logs, mud, and rocks.
                  Lodges: Inside the dams, beavers build lodges, which are dome-shaped structures made of sticks, mud, and other materials. Lodges have an underwater entrance, which provides safety and protection from predators like wolves, bears, and humans.
                  Ponds: The dams create ponds around their lodges, where they build a network of underwater tunnels. These ponds help keep the water level high, allowing easy access to their food stores during the winter.</p></aside><hr>

                <img class="pic" src="images/swimming.jpg">
                <aside id="aside_swimmer"><p>Beavers are excellent swimmers, and they are well adapted to life in the water:

                  Swimming Skills: Beavers are strong, agile swimmers, thanks to their webbed feet, which act like paddles in the water. They can swim at speeds of up to 5 miles per hour (8 km/h) when necessary.
                  Tail: Their flat, scaly tails serve as rudders, helping them steer and balance while swimming. They use their tails to propel themselves in the water, especially when swimming longer distances.
                  Underwater Diving: Beavers can stay underwater for several minutes. Their thick fur keeps them warm, and they have specialized lips that close behind their teeth to prevent water from entering their mouths when they are chewing or cutting underwater.
                  Night Swimmers: Beavers are typically nocturnal, so they often do most of their swimming and foraging at night. Their large, webbed feet and strong swimming capabilities allow them to move through their aquatic environment with ease.</p></aside> <hr>
